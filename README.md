Rainfall Prediction in Sydney - Machine Learning Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting rainfall in Sydney based on weather-related variables. The project utilizes various classification models and ensemble techniques to improve the accuracy of rainfall predictions.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting rainfall in Sydney based on historical weather data. The dataset covers weather-related variables from 2008 to 2017, and the objective is to leverage these data to build robust predictive models.

Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
Replace missing values with the mean.
Check for outliers in the rainfall data.
Model Selection:

Utilize a range of classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing datasets.
Train each model on the training dataset.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, ROC AUC, recall, and precision.
Model Comparison:

Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.
Model Optimization:

Fine-tune model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to improve accuracy.
